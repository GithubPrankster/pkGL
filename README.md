# pkGL
OpenGL Renderer in C++ with OBJ and texture loading

**Dependencies:**

*GLFW 3.2: Window stuff, Input, etc.* **ZLib License**

*GLAD: 4.6 core, can be modified on code for other versions. Remember to put in the glad.c on stuff.* **MIT License**

*tiny_obj_loader.h: OBJ loading.* **MIT License**

*stb_image.h: Image loading.* **Public Domain**

**Setup:**

All you need to do is supply GLFW and GLAD, and then put in an OBJ and a texture for it. Go nuts.

Example of a scene in pkGL:
